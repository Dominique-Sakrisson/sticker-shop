# Mock sticker shop

Api that allows a user to make fake orders of different stickers

Utilizes AWS for storage of the orders 

Twilio SMS will also sends out a notification of the order
(message is stuck to being sent to a number provided by the service, cannot set to have clients recieve to their numbers)
